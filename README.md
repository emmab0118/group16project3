# Group 16 Project 3
## Conway's Game of Life

For our project, we created a playable version of the Conway's Game of Life simulation​. Our project is heavily dependent on React, DOM manipulation, and MySQL integration via PHP​. The project contains several pages: namely a home page, game page, login and registration pages, and an admin panel for user management.
