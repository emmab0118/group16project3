    <h1>How to Play Conway's Game of Life</h1>

    <p>Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It's a zero-player game, meaning its evolution is determined by its initial state and does not require further input from humans.</p>
    
    <h2 id="rules">The Rules</h2>
    
    <p>Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states: alive or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbors, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:</p>
    
    <div class="rule">
        <strong>1. Underpopulation:</strong> Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies (as if by underpopulation).
    </div>
    
    <div class="rule">
        <strong>2. Survival:</strong> Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
    </div>
    
    <div class="rule">
        <strong>3. Overpopulation:</strong> Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (as if by overpopulation).
    </div>
    
    <div class="rule">
        <strong>4. Reproduction:</strong> Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell (as if by reproduction).

    <h2 id="controls">Game Controls</h2>
    
    <div class="controls">
        <p><strong>Start/Pause:</strong> Begins or pauses the simulation</p>
        <p><strong>Next:</strong> Advances the simulation by one generation</p>
        <p><strong>+23 Gen:</strong>Advances the simulation by 23 generations</p>
        <p><strong>Clear:</strong> Resets the grid</p>
        <p><strong>Set Size:</strong> Changes the dimensions of the grid</p>
